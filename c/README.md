# QiSpace-SDK-Demo-C-App

A functionality demo based in C/C++ to demonstrate the usage of the QEEP, SEQUR and PQRND APIs as well as QiSpace RESTful API. For best running experience, run the demo on an Ubuntu computer.

## **Overview**
- #### SEQUR: Demonstrates the use of SEQUR API to decode arbitrary QiSpace Enterprise payloads using either a pre-loaded or QiSpace-REST-API-retrieved subscriber key (subkey).
- #### QEEP: Demonstrates the use of QEEP API for encryption/decryption and, if desired, the process of retrieving a Quantum Key (QK) from QiSpace Enterprise. 
- #### PQRND: Demonstrates the use of PQRND API for generating Pseudo Quantum RaNdom Data with either pre-loaded Quantum Entropy (QE) or QiSpace-REST-API-retrieved QE.

## **Installation and Preparation**
1. Download this git repository to local machine
2. Place the `lib` folder containing QEEP and SEQUR libraries for your OS under this repository's root (`/c`)
3. Copy the `qispace_info.h` file which contains the QiSpace API URL and access token into `/src` directory
  - Note: If the mentioned `lib` folder and `qispace_info.h` are not available to you, please contact Quantropi Support team.
4. Run `make install_depends` to install required libraries 
  - nlohmann json
  - libcurl

  If an error occurs, consider running the makefile commands individually.

## **Getting Started**
### Offline Mode (Dry-run) 
  - Run "make [sequr, qeep, pqrnd]" (i.e `make qeep`)

### Online Mode (QiSpace interaction is needed in this mode)
  - Run "make [sequr, seep, pqrnd] QISPACE_API_ON=1" (i.e `make pqrnd QISPACE_API_ON=1`)

Note: After a demo finishes, consider running `make clean` for consistent demo execution.
