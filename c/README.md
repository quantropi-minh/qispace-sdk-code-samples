# Qeep-SDK-Demo-C-App

A functionality demo based in C/C++ to demonstrate the usage of the QEEP, SEQUR and PQRND APIs as well as QiSpace RESTful API. For best running experience, run the demo on an Ubuntu computer.

## **Overview:**
- #### SEQUR: Demonstrates the use of SEQUR API to decode arbitrary QiSpace Enterprise payloads using either a pre-loaded or QiSpace-REST-API-retrieved subscriber key (subkey)
- #### QEEP: Demonstrates usage of QEEP API for encryption/decryption and, if desired, the process of retrieving a Quantum Key from QiSpace Enterprise. 
- #### PQRND: Demonstrates usage of PQRND API for generating Pseudo Quantum RaNdom Data with either pre-loaded Quantum Entropy or QiSpace-REST-API-retrieved QE.

## **Installation and Preparation:**
1. Download or checkout this git repository to local machine
2. Place the `lib` folder containing QEEP and SEQUR libraries for your OS under this repository's root (`/c`)
3. Copy the `qispace_info.h` file which contains the QiSpace API URL and Access token into `/src` directory
  - Note: If the mentioned `lib` folder and `qispace_info.h` are not available to you, please contact Quantropi Support team.
4. Run `make install_depends` to install required libraries 
  - nlohmann json
  - libcurl

  Consider running the makefile commands individually if an error occurs

## **Getting started:**
### Offline Mode (Dry-run): 
  - Run "make [sequr, qeep, pqrnd]" (i.e `make qeep`)

### Online Mode: (QiSpace interaction is needed in this mode)
  - run "make [sequr, seep, pqrnd] QISPACE_API_ON=1" (i.e `make pqrnd QISPACE_API_ON=1`)

Note: After a demo finishes, consider running `make clean` for consistent demo execution. 

*For more information, please refer the MAKEFILE for detail*
