# QiSpace_SDK_Demos
This repository contains example code in the form of demos and apps for Quantropi SEQUR, QEEP and PQRND APIs as well as the QiSpace RESTful APIs for retrieving subscriber keys, Quantum Keys and Quantum Entropy. The purpose of these demos are to provide developers with ideas on how the APIs can used correctly, rather than enforce strict implementation practices.

*It can be expected to find inside*
- a terminal-based C demo which requires installing additional libcurl and Nlohmann Json libraries.
- Android app demos in Java and Kotlin developed in Android Studio. 
- as well as iOS app demos in Swift and Objective C.

While the demos' source code can be viewed immediately, it may be necessary to contact Quantropi support for demo-specific classes and files containing QiSpace information in order to run and enable the full functionality of the app.

For more details, see their READMEs in their respective folders. Also, more additional generic API information can be found again through Quantropi support or via the Quantropi website.
